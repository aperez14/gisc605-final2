GIS605 Lab 7/final exam
1. Create a repository called gisc605-final in your GitHub account (make sure it is public)
Please use the github/codespaces-jupyter repository as a template repository
2. Add a README.md file to your repository
Please modify this file by adding your CSULB student email. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo.
3. Add a file called final_a.sh to your repository
Please write a bash script with a single function called gisc605 that uses echo to output your CSULB username. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo.
4. Add a file called final_b.sh to your repository
Please write a bash script with list the contents of your final_a.sh script with cat. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo.
5. Add a file called final.ipynb to your repository
An alternative workflow is to use Google Collaboratory to create a Jupyter Notebook
Write a function called howdy_planet that uses print() to output "Howdy Planet!"
In another code cell in the same notebook instantiate a variable called directions and set it equal to a list of the four cardinal directions: ["North", "South", "East", "West"]
Write a for loop that uses print() to output the contents of directions
If using Codespaces, commit your changes.
If using Colab, make sure to download your Jupyter Notebook and upload to your GitHub repo gisc605-final
